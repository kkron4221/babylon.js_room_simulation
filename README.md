Cubes with multiple movements are deployed in space.
When the cube detects an object, it has an action to avoid it.
As an image of the concept, the shortest route measurement of a micromouse would be useful.
Finally, a room is created and the optimal spatial arrangement is verified by moving the objects in the room.
